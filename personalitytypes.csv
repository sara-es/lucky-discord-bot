DNC,"Dancers are the social butterflies of the battlefield, grooving to the beat of their own performance while chaos reigns around them. That doesn't mean they're not observant, either. A Dancer will always be game for a chat; arguably the most important (and complex) part of their rotation."

RDM,"Red Mages are experimentalists at heart and nothing says that better than perceiving new uses for old ideas. Did anyone else ever think to try mixing black magic with white? No? Well, that's why you're a Red Mage and get to have the best of both worlds. Some would call that trying to have your cake and eat it. Red Mages would call it resourceful and bold. Three guesses for who they think is right in that debate."

SMN,"It takes a strong will to bind even the smallest essence of a primal to one's own will, an art that Summoners have deftly mastered since time immemorial. Some may find their methods unconventional, but Summoners care not what others think. What you see is what you get.

They also have the patience of a saint. A must-have for dealing with a rotation spanning longer than a wall-to-wall dungeon pull."

WHM,"White Mages, unlike their selfish forebears, use the arcane art of succor only for the betterment of others. Outwardly selfless and unrivalled in the school of reactive curative spells, Gridania's mages are outwardly calm and remarkably perceptive... as long as Swiftcast is off cooldown ~~blood for the blood lily~~"

PLD,"Paladins are the born leaders of Eorzea's finest combatants. Reliable, uncorruptable and always clad in armour requiring sunglasses to see with any clarity, the elite of the Sultansworn will do anything to protect that which matters most, and they'll never let you forget it, either.
""Remember the time I protected us all from certain death?"" is a common bar tale."

BLM,"To survive beyond their first *ahem* 'initiation' at the thaumaturge's guild, Black Mages need to be forward thinkers, always second guessing their enemy's movements before knowing their own. The trick, of course, is to funnel the fearsome elemental energy at their disposal towards its intended target while remembering that they too, have fully functioning legs."

GNB,"Owing to the job's proud heritage as personal protectors of Queen Gunnhildr, Gunbreakers are strong-willed and self-confident. As a frontline warrior, they know how to inspire and instil confidence in their allies on charisma alone. For that reason, you'd be forgiven for thinking that the secret ingredient for a gunblade's cartridges was pure, unfiltered adrenaline rather than aether."

BRD,"Despite what you may think, creatively-minded folks make for redoubtable warriors. Charming, artistic and imaginative to boot, Bards will pen a morale-boosting ballad out of anything, even if said music sheet foretells the End of Days. Curiosity, however, can (and often does) kill the cat. Bards will try anything once, even if their unpredictable inquisitiveness means getting themselves (and others) into trouble."
DRK,"If your mandate was to look out for the little guy and prioritize fair treatment for all, you'd probably be a brooding sword-for-hire too. Don't let that fa√ßade fool you, though. Dark Knights find joy in hard work and are fiercely loyal to the right people owing to their excellent judge of character.
They also like really, really big swords. Who said you needed a shield to protect?"

MCH,"There's a reason Machinists spend the majority of their time tinkering with all sorts of gadgetry. Resourceful and creative, Ishgard's famed engineers are always knee-deep in their next project. This can be a double-edged drill, as you won't want to let a machinist get bored, lest the next must-have gadget have a bit too many bells and whistles (read: flamethrowers and robots)."
SAM,"Owing to their art being forged in the crucible of war, Samurai waste no time in telling you exactly what they mean, often with the pointy end of a katana. A strong preference for calm and order they may present, but Samurai will dutifully protect that which matters most.
Oh, and never, ever tell one that your sword cuts deeper than theirs or else risk being directed to the nearest combat dummy for a measuring contest."
DRG,"Dragoons are renowned for shouldering responsibility, even if that means risking their life to defeat a winged reptile with more pent-up rage than a primal. Boasting unparalleled determination to protect their home, the only thing that'll get between a Dragoon and their foe is a poorly-timed leap of blind faith."

NIN,"Highly-trained combatants hailing from the Far East, Ninjas excel, if not in direct confrontation, then creatively dispatching with their foes. By weaving intricate signs, Ninjas can harness the power of primal elements - which apparently includes bunnies, though they'd rather you didn't draw attention to that ""skill""."

MNK,"A Monk's strength comes not from external sources, but within. Feared warriors hailing from Ala Mhigo, they rely on the power of their body's chakra and a thick-skinned pair of fist to 'encourage' retreat. Idealistic and full of conviction, monks may focus too intently on their goals at times, losing sight of the bigger picture... but hopefully not the boss's positionals."
AST,"Astrologians are the free-form thinkers of the healing profession. Rather than rely on traditional curative spells or a fairy to do all the work, they take inspiration from the stars and divine a path to health and good fortune. Unfortunately, the profession isn't particularly reliable, meaning you'll often find Eorzea's fortune tellers worrying more about their card deck than the status of their party."
SAGE,"Blending field medicine and aetherology, Sharlayan's sages pride themselves on their unique perspectives and vigorous intellect. They may seem cold, abstract, or detached at times - or maybe they can't hear you over the sound of lasers. 
Lasers, bro, lasers."

SCH,"Scholars view the world through the lens of logic and have confidence in their own planning. If the solution to a problem isn't well thought out, they'll be more than happy to give you the ""correct"" answer. While this can sometimes be misconstrued as emotionless criticism, in truth, it's because they don't understand why you've died to avoidable damage *again* and don't care about your excuses."
